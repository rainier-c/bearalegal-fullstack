# Bearalegal

## What is Bearalegal?

Bearalegal is a 'virtual paralegal' that lives in Slack. In short, he's a Slackbot you can
summon to help fetch important files, forms, and policies.

This is a proof-of-concept/MVP project I completed while at Hack Reactor. 

## Can I try him out?

Bearalegal isn't yet distributed on the Slack app store, so only I have the ability to install him in a Slack workspace.

However, you can view chunks of him in action:

- Backend (hosted on Heroku-- please give the dynos a few seconds to warm up!): https://warm-hamlet-95555.herokuapp.com/
